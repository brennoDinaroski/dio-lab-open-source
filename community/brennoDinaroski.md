Hello, I'm Brenno Dinaroski. 
I live in Curitiba and have 27 years old. I've gratuated in 2020 in Civil Engineering at PUCPR, I have a little company for civil engineering projects and now I'm working like Web Developer Front End. 
My big goal for the next five years is to live in London- Ontario in Canada and create two wealth companies, one for tech purposes to focus on ecommerces and softwares Saas, and another in the financial consulting field to promote a better financial life for everyone!
